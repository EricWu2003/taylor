[Intro]
Meet me at midnight

[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny
You handled it beautifully
All this shit is new to me

[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Verse 2]
All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one-night or a wife

[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying
They're bringing up my history
But you weren't even listening

[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Post-Chorus]
That lavender haze

[Bridge]
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

[Chorus]
I feel, the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Outro]
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
The lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
