The goal of taylor is to provide easy access to a curated data set of Taylor Swift songs, including lyrics and audio characteristics. Data comes [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift) and the [Spotify API](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wjakethompson/taylor")
```

## Example

There are three main data sets. The first is `tswift_album_songs`, which includes lyrics and audio features from the Spotify API for all songs on Taylor's official studio albums. Notably this excludes singles released separately from an album (e.g., *Only the Young*, *Christmas Tree Farm*, etc.), and non-Taylor-owned albums that have a Taylor-owned alternative (e.g., *Fearless* is excluded in favor of *Fearless (Taylor's Version)*). We stan artists owning their own songs.

```{r album-songs}
tswift_album_songs
```

You can access Taylor's entire discography with `tswift_all_songs`. This includes all of the songs in `tswift_album_songs` plus EPs, individual singles, and the original versions of albums that have been re-released as *Taylor's Version*.

```{r all-songs}
tswift_all_songs
```

Finally, there is a small data set, `tswift_albums`, summarizing Taylor's album release history.

```{r albums}
tswift_albums
```
